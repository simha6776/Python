Implement and demonstrate FIND-S Algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based 

on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.

import csv

hypothesis = [] # Initialize the most specific hypothesis

# Read the training data

with open('C:/Users/acer/Downloads/trainingdata.csv') as csv_file: 

 reader = csv.reader(csv_file)

 data = list(reader)

print("The given training examples are:")

for row in data:

 print(row)

# Filter only the positive examples (where the class label is 'Yes')

positive_examples = [row for row in data if row[-1].strip().lower() == 'yes']

print("\nThe positive examples are:")

for example in positive_examples:

 print(example)

# Initialize the hypothesis as the first positive example (excluding the class label)

hypothesis = positive_examples[0][:-1]

for example in positive_examples: # Apply Find-S algorithm

 for i in range(len(hypothesis)):

 if hypothesis[i] != example[i]:

 hypothesis[i] = ‘?’ # Generalize 

print("\nThe maximally specific hypothesis is:") # Final result

print(hypothesis)
